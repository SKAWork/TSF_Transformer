Upcoming Features

<strong><u>Pol2Vec embedding</strong></u>

Equivalent of Word2Vec for polynomials.

Will use the skip-gram algorithm to learn meaningful polynomial embeddings.

<strong><u>Output discretization for softmax</strong></u>

Group similar polynomial outputs to reduce the continuous space.

Enables the application of softmax, improving prediction modeling.

<strong><u>Enhanced training dataset</strong></u>

Improve diversity of the training dataset.

Reduce the number of overly similar features to improve model learning and generalization.
